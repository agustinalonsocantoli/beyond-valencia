    description: "Our knowledgeable guide will lead the way, sharing fascinating insights about the region's rich agricultural heritage, vibrant flora, and the traditional cultivation practices that have shaped this beautiful landscape. Immerse yourself in the scents and colors of the Valencian Orchard as you cycle through its charming trails, capturing the essence of this hidden gem",
    information: "Valencia's Huerta not only supplies the markets and restaurants of Valencia, but its abundant production of fruits and vegetables is exported to the rest of Spain and abroad. Its irrigation system, a legacy from Arab times, is a display of ingenuity that has been recognized by the FAO as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS). It has also given rise to a unique institution declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage: the Water Tribunal, which is responsible for its regulation, and which continues to meet every Thursday at noon at the gate of the Apostles of the Cathedral. Finally, it is important to remember that without this farmland and its rice paddies, the most universal of Valencian dishes, the paella, would not exist.",
